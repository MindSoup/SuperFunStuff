Ok I think we should actually use this to outline plans for the game, maybe a todo list.

TODO:
1) Decide what we're actually going to do
2) Put description of what we're actually going to do below

Sounds like a plan.

I think it would be easier to do a card game with regular cards first. Then incorperate our own ideas
Into it.
