Ok I think we should actually use this to outline plans for the game, maybe a todo list.

TODO:
1) Decide what we're actually going to do
2) Put description of what we're actually going to do below

Sounds like a plan.

I think it would be easier to do a card game with regular cards first. Then incorperate our own ideas
Into it.

Let's do it.

Let's do war, cuz it's simple and needs almost no AI.

Actually, that would be really boring cuz the player would only press a button over and over again to draw a card.
