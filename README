Ok I think we should actually use this to outline plans for the game, maybe a todo list.

TODO:
1) Decide what we're actually going to do
2) Put description of what we're actually going to do below

Sounds like a plan.

I think it would be easier to do a card game with regular cards first. Then incorperate our own ideas
Into it.

Let's do it.

Let's do war, cuz it's simple and needs almost no AI.

Actually, that would be really boring cuz the player would only press a button over and over again to draw a card.

Or we could do this -

"This simple variant, designed by Erik Arneson, adds some decision-making to the game.

After the cards are dealt, each player draws the top three from his pile and holds them in his hand. On each turn, he chooses one card to play and then draws a new card to refresh his hand to three cards.

When a tie occurs, each player takes three cards from his face down pile and puts them in the middle, still face down. He then chooses a card from his hand to play as the face-up fourth card. The player who plays the higher card takes all six of the face-down cards plus the two "fourth" cards. The player who plays the lower card takes the two cards which caused the war to take place."
